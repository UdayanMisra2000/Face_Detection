# Face_Detection
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc..

1. In Single Face detection we will detect only 1 face in a given image;
2. In Multiple Face detection we will detect only multiple faces in a given image;
3. And in moving face detection we will detect multiple faces in a video or a webcam (in this code its webcam).
